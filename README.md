info:

- usernames must be between 3-15 characters long
- program only checks for availavle users not for banned users so it will put banned users under 'available'
- program saves avaialable users into 'available.txt'
- program saves users that could not be checked becuase you were rate limited under 'error.txt'

how to use:

- paste usernames into 'usernames.txt'
- run check.exe or if you want to use the src do python check.py in console
- then program should work
